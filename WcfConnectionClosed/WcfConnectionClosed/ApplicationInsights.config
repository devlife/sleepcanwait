                     quick request times, you might want to lower this to match your application component's performance

        <!-- Microsoft Monitoring Agent always collects a predefined set of performance counters (such as 
                     Process CPU, Network IO, Exception Rate, Performance index) for every monitored application.  
                     You can also configure the agent to collect more system or custom performance counters.

                     For example:

                          <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\Memory\Available Bytes"/>
                          <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" />
    
                     The format of the counterSpecifier is:
 
                          \PerformanceCounterCategory(Instance)\Counter 

                     Instance must be specified if the performance category is of the multi-instance type.  
 	                 Specify * to collect all instances. For example:
        	              <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\LogicalDisk(*)\Disk Reads/sec" />

                     For the following specific category instances, the Agent can discover the right instance for your web application.
                     For example:
                          <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\Process(w3wp?)\% Processor Time" />
                          <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\.NET CLR Memory(w3wp?)\% Time in GC" />
                          <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\ASP.NET Applications(?)\Request Execution Time" />

                     To discover performance counters available in your machine, use
